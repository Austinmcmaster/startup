### Elevator Pitch

This application is focused on adding entries which can be subjects, hobbies or other task and calculating your data in an easy format to see where your time is spent. So simply, a user inputs a subject along with a time entry. The server end will grab the data associated with that week and create a pie chart / graph showing allocated time.
